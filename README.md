I provide R scripts for data cleaning and several econometric applications, including OLS regressions, panel data models, and limited dependent variable models. I also carried out analyses on the influence of children on womenâ€™s labor market participation and education. Finally, I include graphs illustrating the evolution and characteristics of labor force participation in Brazil.
